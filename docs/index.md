The documentation should help you running the HoneyCube Engine and describe not only the concepts applied but gives reasoning for the decisions taken. We hope this way the project is not only useful for those which plan to build their own engine using XNA or even want to use HoneyCube but for those who want to learn the rudimental concepts behind game programming (like we do).

## HoneyCube is a playground

Consequently we see HoneyCube more as a playground than an engine ready for use in productive environments. It will combine the knowledge of the community in a single product that could be used for creating your next games. While performance is a fundamental aspect in game development, ease of use and a comprehensible code base are given precedence. We are no experts and simply want to try out things and learn from experience. [Join us!][contributors]

## Extensive Inline Documentation

If you don't find what you are looking for on these pages have a look on the code. All files should be well documented using inline comments.
