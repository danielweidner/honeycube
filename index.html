            <p>
                HoneyCube is not an attempt to reinvent the wheel. There are a variaty of good game engines for different purposes available in the market. <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a>, <a href="">OGRE</a>, <a href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/">Irrlicht</a>, just to name a few. Why bother with the HoneyCube Engine then?

            <h2>HoneyCube as a learning plattform</h2>

            <p>
                The project is an attempt to learn more about the fundamentals of game programming. We want to provide a look behind the curtain and play arround with the different technologies involved. The project site you are looking at thereby will document the overall learning process together with the provided source code.
